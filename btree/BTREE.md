## The Node Data Structure 

Let's break down the components of the node data structure in the B-tree:

**1. Header:**

- Type (2 bytes): Indicates whether the node is a leaf node or an internal node.
- nkeys (2 bytes): Represents the number of keys stored in the node.

**2. Pointers (List of nkeys * 8 bytes):**

- Present only in internal nodes.
- Each pointer (8 bytes) corresponds to a child node. Internal nodes use these pointers to navigate through the tree structure.

**3. Offsets (List of nkeys * 2 bytes):**

- Each offset points to the location of the corresponding key-value pair within the key-values section.
- The offset is relative to the start of the key-values section.
- The first offset is always 0, as it points to the beginning of the key-values section.

**4. Key-Values (Packed KV pairs):**
- Pairs of key-value data.
- klen (2 bytes): Length of the key.
- vlen (2 bytes): Length of the value.
- key (variable length): The actual key data.
- val (variable length): The actual value data.
- These pairs are packed together without any separators.

This node structure is designed to be persisted to disk, and its format allows for efficient traversal and retrieval of key-value pairs during search operations. The use of offsets helps in locating the position of each key-value pair within the packed data, facilitating quick access.

It's worth noting that having a consistent format for both leaf and internal nodes simplifies the implementation and provides a uniform way to handle nodes during various tree operations.
